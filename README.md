# DISCO Figures üï∫

## About this Repository:
<b> If you have DISCO NMR results to plot, this is the place for you! </b> This repository provides a low-maintenance, customizable template for generating standard DISCO NMR polymer-protein interaction fingerprint plots.

## Quickstart:
‚û°Ô∏è There is a fully worked example to generate publication-ready figures in `notebooks/polymer_profiles.ipynb`. 

In it, we regenerate the profiles for hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) interactions with mucin protein at two molecular weights.
 
Profiles inlude:
* DISCO Polymer Binding Interaction Fingerprints
* DISCO Polymer Build-Up Curve Plots
* DISCO Polymer Change Profiles (snapshot, and comprehensive versions)

To get a sense of how this repo works, navigate to `notebooks/polymer_profiles.ipynb` and run all cells. Plotting functions are pulled in from the `utils` file. Each plotting utility function contains a descriptive docstring. 

The functions in `utils/plotting.py` are additionally provided with executable examples to give you an intuition for the code.

## Plotting with other datasets:
Other polymer-protein interaction profiles from DISCO NMR can be easily plotted with this repo. 
Add any new data files in `data/raw`, read the files into the `polymer_profiles.ipynb` notebook, and make use of our plotting util functions to construct DISCO profile plots.

This template is intended to be an all-in-one place to work on your publication figures for a paper that applies DISCO NMR.

</p>

2) In your desired Python environment, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in Terminal to install prerequisite dependencies for this repository

3) Set up `science-plots` matplotlib style for publication quality formatting:\
    i) Follow the instructions provided by the package author, including installation of LaTex: https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots

4) Set up DISCO Custom Colour Palette:\
    i) find .matplotlib dir on your machine by typing the terminal commands:\
    `>>> python` (activate Python in Terminal)\
    `>>> import matplotlib as mpl`\
    `>>> mpl.get_configdir()` (output referred to as dir)\
    ii) navigate to dir/stylelib (may require you to enable showing hidden files on your machine)\
    iii) move the provided discolib file in this repo to your custom style directory:\
    `notebooks/utils/discolib.mplstyle` to --> `dir/stylelib`

## Data Input Format:
In this release, our raw data tables are automatically-generated outputs from another Python module for disco data processing, currently under development. ‚öôÔ∏è

To maximize ease of use we will continue to maintain format compatibility between the disco data processing module outputs, and input files to this template plotting repository. 

‚û°Ô∏è Feel free to make any customizations as required on your machine for data input formatting, until the data processing module is released.
